# API Service Component & Testing: Prompt History

## 2025-09-17T12:37:00 — Initial Requirements

- Develop a reusable React component for backend API integration.
- Accept API endpoint configuration in YAML format (company-specific).
- Manage server interactions (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Validate data as per YAML rules.
- Handle authentication via in-memory token.
- Modular architecture: verify endpoint, validate data, perform request, support retries, fetch from mock/cache, handle errors, return response.
- Provide a hook for notification of server interaction completion (success/error).
- Review Angular implementation in FarmGrid app.
